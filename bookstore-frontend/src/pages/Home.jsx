            <span className="text-success fw-bold">ðŸ“šBook</span>
              <span className="text-white">Nerds</span> was founded by Kaleem Akhtar Khan and Hemant Kumar, two passionate Computer Science engineering students with a shared vision for transforming education through technology. As aspiring software engineers, we witnessed the barriers students face when trying to access quality learning resources â€” from limited availability to affordability and reach.

            Driven by our belief in the power of education to uplift and empower, we set out to create a platform that bridges these gaps. <span className="text-success fw-bold">ðŸ“šBook</span>
              <span className="text-white">Nerds</span> was born from countless late-night brainstorming sessions, lines of code, and a commitment to making learning simple, engaging, and accessible for everyone â€” no matter where they are.

            Today, <span className="text-success fw-bold">ðŸ“šBook</span>
              <span className="text-white">Nerds</span> stands as a growing digital learning hub â€” built by students, for students â€” with the goal of connecting learners worldwide through books, community, and opportunity. Our journey has just begun, and weâ€™re excited to continue shaping the future of education.
